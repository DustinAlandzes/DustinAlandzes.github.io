My setup for this is much better than my usual way of doing things. The actual website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is an amazing little static site generator. 

#Jekyll & Hyde

I came across [Alex Bilbie's](http://alexbilbie.com/) website while doing an investigation into [OAuth](http://alexbilbie.com/2015/04/oauth-open-redirector-attack/) and the look caught my eye. I found out he used [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), which is a theme for Jekyll, and decided why not.

Jekyll is essentially a little [CMS](https://wordpress.org/) that can do whatever you want it to. The blog posts are generated from Markdown files in the _posts folder, Hyde's sidebar links are generated from any files that have [YAML](http://yaml.org/) front matter blocks, and from there you can change things as much or as little as you want.

I changed the theme color to green, changed the font of the title, and now I'm a web designer.

#Home is where you make it

I finally decided to try out [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) the other day with [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/homestead), and it was one of the better choices I've made recently.
