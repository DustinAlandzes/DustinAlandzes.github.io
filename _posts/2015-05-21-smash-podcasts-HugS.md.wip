##Questions from the Smash Community

**[Dr. PeePee](http://smashboards.com/members/dr-peepee.74236/) - "What do you think of a Melee match? Do you see it as a form of Rock-Paper-Scissors, Frame Advantages, or do you try to learn player habits and go off of experience?"**  
I do kind of see it as Rock-Paper-Scissors, but it's obviously more than that. I believe that everything in the game has a counter, and especially with a character like mine, who is limited, you have to be acutely aware of those counters and all of their options.  
When I'm playing, I try to figure out how to counter everything they do, and if I'm ever beaten I say well-- did I lose because I had no choice? Or was it because I didn't know the counter? 100% of the time, I'll think about it, know the counter and apply it next time.   
So that's how I see the game, and pretty much what I do is from building that and understanding what the counters are, I tend to have... I don't want to call it an auto-pilot, but I tend to be able to flow in every match, and not have to reapply everything. It's already kind of embedded in me, and that's how I go about playing my matches.  
**So it sounds like Rock-Paper-Scissors in terms of matchups, each situation within each matchup has a kind of Rock-Paper-Scissors**  
Once you figure out that Rock beats Scissors, and you know that after your Rock beats their Scissors they're going to pull out Paper, and you have to get your Scissors out after that. It's like a sequence of counters that I try to learn. I do try to learn player habits, that's always the most important that I try to do in every single match I play.

**[N1000](http://smashboards.com/members/n1000.164945/) asks "What are some of your favorite players, currently active and retired. What do you like about their play styles?"**  
Active would be [Mango](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:mango). Mango is... I mean sometimes I play him, and you know how I told you about that whole counter situation? I play him and I just can't figure out how he counters me. I didn't give him a scenario to counter. It seems like you can't play like that unless you travel in time and know what they're going to do. It's kind of dumb, but that's not to say it's dumb. But yeah, Mango is my favorite active player.  
I like watching [Lucky](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:Lucky).   
As far as old-school players go, I really like [DSF](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:DSF)'s style, same with [Drephen](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Drephen). I really like awkward/janky kinds of styles that a lot of people aren't playing. It's... It's refreshing, and they work too. I mean a lot of people don't... a lot of people do the whole bread and butter thing. They copy and paste, and it's refreshing to see players do their own unique thing.  
So yeah, current would be Mango and Lucky. On the East Coast, I like [Hax](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Hax). I know a lot of people have problems with his attitude, but he's cool, and I do like his style.  
[Jman](http://www.ssbwiki.com/Jman)'s cool, Jman's really campy, really gay. I like that. it's really good.

**What I like about that janky playstyle you were talking about, is they make you figure out their stupid play style, and by the time you figure it out you're already 2 stocks down and then they already know what you're going to do**

**Maybe we should ask you to elucidate on your [Ganon's alleged sickness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSYW033VYdE)**  
Sick ass ganon dude, sick. Alright, for those of you who don't know, I have hands down the sickest Ganon on the west coast. No competition. It has been the sickest Ganon for longer than my Samus has been good. So sick that it's in critical condition. I'm very proud of my ganon. I think I have more character pride in my Ganon than anyone does in any of their characters. So if you haven't seen my Ganon, [check it out on Youtube](). It's sick

**[Jack of Blades](http://smashboards.com/members/jack-of-blades.69685/) asks "What has been the biggest smash related road block? How did you overcome it?"**  
My biggest smash related roadblock has to be... When you become good, after the MLG era I was an established player. What became hardest for me to overcome was the whole ego thing. If someone were to see me, the repercussions would always be in my head while I'm playing. It's hard to thinking about winning when you're only thinking about about not losing. Those are two completely different mindsets. One is the winning mindset and one is the losing mindset. The more you think about not wanting to lose, the more likely you are to lose.  
That was one of the hardest things to get over. It took me a long time, I just recently got over it. What I learned was to get rid of your ego and just not... It's cliche to say not to worry but, the only way you can really do that is to not have an ego. You have to go in to each match with confidence in yourself.  
Confidence relative to yourself, not relative to your opponent.  
Some people will think 'Oh, you need confidence'. You think "Who am I playing? Jman? Oh I rape Jman, I'm going to beat him". No. That's stupid. What you have to think is "Oh I'm playing Jman? Well I'm playing my absolute best, so fuck it. I'm ready. Let's go" And I guarantee you're more likely to win that way, than thinking any other way. If you're really thinking that someone like Jman, or Hax, or Lucky is a pushover. "Yeah, I'm going to rape them." Then yeah, you're going to get fucked up. You can't think like that. You have to be confident in yourself, you have to get rid of your ego. That's what I learned."

**??? asked "What made you commit to a character like Samus?"**  
I committed to Samus because I really enjoy [Dragon Ball Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vewFPWn7-TI). I've said this in an interview before. She was the only one who looked like they had Dragon Ball Z moves. So I started using her, and I wanted to quit, but then I saw Wes winning with her. I thought that well, this is a me problem, not a Samus problem if he's winning with her, so I gotta get better. And that's what I did. I got better than Wes, for sure. There are some people out there who doubt that, but uh... After getting better with her I had a certain pride in maintaining my reputation as the best Samus in the world. That's why I commit to the character. I want to keep her going, and I want to see how far I can go with her.

**What kind of balance do you maintain between smash and your daily responsibilities"**

I am a busy motherfucker. I go to school full-time, I work 20 hours a week, currently interning for one of the big four accounting firms. I've got a lot on my plate. And you know, a lot of people quit smash because of "oh, I've got to focus on school". How do I say this... You don't really have to, you can make time for smash. Granted, you'll improve at a slower rate, but if you're already good. Like a lot of those people are, who end up quitting because of school. You don't need to practice ever. You can just show up to tournaments, you can easily make time. I play at one tournament every two weeks, maybe three weeks, and I only practice about four hours total within two weeks. So you know, it doesn't take up that much time. Just play with your friends, have fun. It's an easy balance, it's not that terrible

**How long do you intend to pursue your smash career?**

Forever baby. Forever. I see myself playing, as old as I get, because you know, it's not really a kids thing anymore. All the people who were playing when they were kids growing up with it. They're going to keep playing, I'm going to keep playing, my friends are going to keep playing. I don't see a reason to stop. Unless they get all girlfriends and disappear. Which happens! That's the number 1 cause of smashers disappearing-- Bitches. Haha.

**No body that posts that they quit actually quit. The people that actually quit just stop posting.**

The longer your retirement speech, the quicker you're going to come back.

**CaptainEvilstomper9 asks "Do you think you would have been more successful if you used a top tier instead of Samus, or do you think Samus compliments your style of play best?"**  No. A lot of people will assume that a mid-tier player would be so much better if they used a better character. I use Samus because that's what fits my style. Some of your might have seen my fox on the live stream, and you know why I play Samus. Samus fits my style, and if I play a better character, I'll probably get raped more.

**"Favorite Combo Video?"**  
[Hey Hugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjlc1k2qxs0)

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjlc1k2qxs0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**At what point did you consider yourself 'Professional'?**  I considered myself on a pro-level probably mid-MLG 06', after my Anaheim performance. Yeah MLG Anaheim is when I thought I was on that pro-level. 

**What reasons can you think of for the lack of Marth and Shiek players in the current North American meta game, despite their obvious strength**  
Players like Ken, Azen, KoreanDJ... they don't exist anymore. There is not a top player there to influence others to pick up that character, so it's going to take awhile to start up. If Wes didn't exist there wouldn't be a lot of Samus players or myself right now, I wouldn't be around. It's just because there's no Ken, they forgot how good Ken was, they forgot how good Azen was, and someone needs to remind them. I dread the day that all the Marths and Shieks come back, but it has got to happen soon. They're good characters, really good characters.  "

**[Etwist51294](http://smashboards.com/members/etwist51294.101990/) asks "How did you come across making a completely new style of Samus instead of just copying what Wes does?"**  
You know how I said the whole counter strategy? There would be times where I would use the Wes strategy and they fuck me up for it. I would think, what does Wes do to beat it? Nothing. They would do things that would beat Wes, and he wouldn't learn from it. He wouldn't change it. So I started coming up with a janky style. It just started morphing from this tiny little thing, and I started adding different layers. Started getting weirder and weirder and weirder, and that's my style now. But yeah, it's just that whole counter style made me develop what I did. No one else is going to counter something the way I will, so if that's my strategy then it will be a unique style.

**Do you think the old school players had better mind games? Were they smarter players than players today?**  "I think they did, only because they had to. They didn't have the technical ability of all the people now, so the mind games are pretty unique, pretty smart. I don't know what else to say about that. But you can really tell that players of old are more mind gaming, whatever that means, than players new. But I think that will change soon. "

**Mang0** - "They're all technical and dumb as fuck. All of them."

**What things should you focus on to quickly adapt to players?**  There's no shortcut to doing that. You have to have played for awhile. You have to have experience. You have to play a lot, and with a lot of different kinds of players. You have to internalize all this information, either subconsciously or consciously and what you'll do in the middle of a match is your brain will push it back up to the forefront when you play someone you can relate to, who you can understand and handle with some past strategy. I remember once I played ROFL and bombs worked against him, and a year later I'm playing Ka-master in finals and I'm getting raped by Luigi and I started using bombs and I started adapting to what he was doing. It's just bringing back old strategies to the forefront for that particular match. It's not something you can do with a shortcut, you have to play for a long time. You have to be experienced, skilled, and smart to be able to do it. "

**Like being able to analyze in a quick period of time, why did I not win in this little confrontation**   Yeah, you have to be smart. You can't be a dumb ass technical player and be able to do that. You can't, you have to be smart.

##[Character Specific Questions]

**Do you have some general advice on the Falcon matchup, since you claim it's one of your best matchups?**  Goal is to stay grounded the whole time. Falcon is the one who is going to have to approach you. So you're just going to be dash dancing to mess with his spacing. The moment he attacks you're going to shield. What I try to do is, like they do it in Street Fighter, you're going to try to cross over to the other side. Almost every character is vulnerable from behind. So the moment he hits my shield, I wavedash behind, and I start my shield jabbing from behind. You jab and a lot of players will tend to jump out on the second hit. So jab, jab, and then you do a forward tilt, and they'll always jump out into the forward tilt. Better players catch on to that so I stop doing it, but it's something you can mixup. Sometimes I'll stand there and not jab, and jab like a second later, to kind of mess with their timing. That's the best it's going to get for you, is to mixup your timing. There's no guaranteed hits against almost anyone. So you're trying to confuse or screw with their timing. As for edgeguarding, what you want to do is stay grounded, until he reaches the end of his up-b and you kind of get a hint of which direction he's going. If he's DI'ing away, I like to do weak fair to strong bair. More damage, and it'll send them flying away, because they're trying to DI the first weak hit. If that doesn't work, I mean you just do it as it goes. Weak back air and if he starts going down you can neutral air or you can spike. If he DI's up and away you can do the sweetspot backair, and you just gotta know if he's coming from below, if he's kind of high you grab the ledge, jump off and neutral air. You want to hit him before he actually reaches the side of the stage, so he has nothing to tech. Edgeguarding is the most important part of the game, because damage comes rarely. Otherwise your whole game is going to involve shielding his all his attacks and pressuring his shield from behind, and then the moment he makes a mistake, it should end up in an edgeguard situation, which you should execute perfectly every time. If you see him up-b'ing far in and he's not DI'ing back to the ledge after up-bing, you want to follow him slowly and downsmash him before he touches the ground so he loses his jump. At low percentages he'll be able to jump back up and back air, possibly twice. At high percentages, whatever he'll be in the air and DI up, and  he won't die. Sometimes when they up-b to the stage, I like to forward smash because they're DI'ing up and away for the downsmash, so they can pop straight up. Now if you forward smash them while they're DI'ing in that manner, they're going to shoot straight to the opposite direction. "

**What do you do when they're up-bing to the ledge from under the stage?**  I end up grabing ledge and dropping neutral air, not too high, not too low. So that the back of my neutral air catches them before they have stage to tech on, and it's usually weak enough so that they can't go high enough to down-b and recover. They'll usually die after you hit them with that. That's what I do
